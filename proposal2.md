Walking Robot

    Going to design a robot that avoids a light that is shinning at it.

Summary
    Going to build a movable robot that is able to go forwards, backwards, left and right depending on 
    where a light is shining on the ground, but the light should be shining on the robot in order to direct it. The robot will 
    be interacting with the users that shine the light. The only way for it to move is by direct light shining at it. 
    But it goes the opposite direction of where ever the light is shinning at, or in other words, just avoiding it entirely.
