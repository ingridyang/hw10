Ardiuno Rolling Ball or Walking Robot

    Going to design a robot that follows the direction a light is shined at, but it has to shine directly 
     at the robot in order for it to know where to go.

(One-sentence summary of your project goes here; then fill out each of the following sections.)

Summary
    Going to build a movable robot that is able to go forwards, backwards, left and right depending on 
    where a light is shining on the ground, but the light should be shining on the robot in order to direct it. It will 
    be interacting with the users that shine the light at the robot. The only way for it to move is by direct light shining at it.
